* Coworkers

## Introduction
Nick Bulen and Marnik Maes were invited to discuss the De Witte Meren Website Overhaul Project. The purpose of the meeting was to gain a basic understanding of the current website, define the project scope, and discuss timing and communication.

## Current Website Overview
The current website is created in Wordpress and maintained by a coworker. It is a basic website with general information, links for registering for an event, and a newsletter. The website is functional but lacks advanced features.

## Project Scope
The project scope is open-ended but must retain the original content and be easily updateable by the coworkers. The MoSCoW principle was discussed to define the project requirements:
* Must haves: Retain original content, editable website structure, digital form for event registration
* Should haves: Easy way to share newsletter, digital calendar, register new event
* Could haves: None at the moment
* Would like to haves: Extra page with links to other organizations

## Timing and Communication
The project doesn't have a fixed timing but it could last up to a year. Agile work methods were suggested, meaning sprints with meetings in between. A meeting every 2-3 weeks would be ideal for regular communication and progress updates.

## Conclusion
A new meeting was scheduled to discuss the project in more detail and agree on a timeline. Nick Bulen and Marnik Maes expressed their satisfaction with the project scope and the agile work method proposed.
