# Meeting 09-03: first meeting

## What?
They are looking for a digital portal for mainly managing data. This portal needs to be easily accessable for a wide target audience. It should be possible to both upload and retrieve data. This data will be in the form of brochures, documents, pictures, etc.


## Next?
Most import now is that we plan a in person meet to get a better understanding of how everything works and functions. We need a better insight into how the website operates right now and have to propose some options for the new digital portal.

When we are there we can also discuss the RA portion of the project and work this out with the client.
